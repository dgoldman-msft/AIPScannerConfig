SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Configures the AIP Scanner

LONG DESCRIPTION
	This will automate the AIP scanner installation on a local system or remote system

PARAMETER ComputerName
    Computer name we are running against

PARAMETER SqlRemote
	Switch to check for remote SQL instnaces

PARAMETER EnableException
	Depending on whether $EnableException is true or false it will do the following:
		1. ($True) - Throw a bloody terminating error. Game over.
		2. ($False) - Write a nice warning about how Foo failed bar, then terminate the function. The return on the next line will then end the calling function.

EXAMPLE
	Start-PrerequisiteCheck -ComputerName Machine01 -Verbose

	This will start the prerequisite checks

EXAMPLE
	Start-PrerequisiteCheck -ComputerName Machine01 -SqlRemote -Verbose

	This will start the prerequisite checks and check for a remote Sql instance

EXAMPLE
	Start-PrerequisiteCheck -ComputerName Machine01 -EnableException

	This will change the termination when we encounter an error

NOTES
	The prerequisites below are still required for successful AIP scanner installation.

	1. A Windows Server 2012 R2 or 2016 Server to run the service with a minimum 4 CPU and 4GB RAM physical or virtual
	2. The scanner will allocate RAM 2.5-3 times of size of all files being scanned in parallel. Thus, if you scan 40 files that are 20MB each at the same time, it should take about 202.540=2GB RAM. However, if you have one big 1GB file it can take 3GB of RAM just for that file.
	3. A SQL Server 2012+ local or remote instance (Any version from Express or better is supported) Sysadmin role needed to install scanner service (user running Install-AIPScanner, not the service account)
	4. If using SQL Server Express, the SQL Instance name is ServerName\SQLExpress.
	5. At this time, a different SQL instance is needed for each AIP Scanner node.

	Service account created in On Premises AD (I will call this account AIPScanner in this document).
	Service requires Log on locally right and Log on as a service right (the second will be given during scanner service install).
	Service account requires Read permissions to each repository for discovery and Read/Write permissions for classification/protection.
	AzInfoProtection.exe available on the Microsoft Download Center (The scanner bits are included with the AIP Client)
